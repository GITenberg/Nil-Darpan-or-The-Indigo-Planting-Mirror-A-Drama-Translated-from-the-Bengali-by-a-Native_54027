<p class='c008'>The original Bengali of this Drama—the <span class='sc'>Nil Darpan, or
Indigo Planting Mirror</span>—having excited considerable interest,
a wish was expressed by various Europeans to see a
translation of it. This has been made by a Native; both the
original and translation are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>bonâ fide</em></span> Native productions and
depict the Indigo Planting System as viewed by Natives at large.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Drama is the favourite mode with the Hindus for
describing certain states of society, manners, customs. Since
the days of Sir W. Jones, by scholars at Paris, St. Petersburgh,
and London, the Sanskrit Drama has, in this point of
view, been highly appreciated. The Bengali Drama imitates
in this respect its Sanskrit parent. The evils of Kulin
Brahminism, widow marriage prohibition, quackery, fanaticism,
have been depicted by it with great effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor has the system of Indigo planting escaped
notice: hence the origin of this work, the <span class='sc'>Nil Darpan</span>,
which, though exhibiting no marvellous or very tragic
scenes, yet, in simple homely language, gives the “annals
of the poor;” pleads the cause of those who are the
feeble; it describes a respectable ryot, a peasant proprietor,
happy with his family in the enjoyment of his land till the
Indigo System compelled him to take advances, to neglect his
own land, to cultivate crops which beggared him, reducing him
to the condition of a serf and a vagabond; the effect of this
on his home, children, and relatives are pointed out in language,
plain but true; it shows how arbitrary power debases the lord
as well as the peasant; reference is also made to the partiality
of various Magistrates in favor of Planters and to the Act of
last year penally enforcing Indigo contracts.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>Attention has of late years been directed by Christian
Philanthropists to the condition of the ryots of Bengal, their
teachers, and the oppression which they suffer, and the conclusion
arrived at is, that there is little prospect or possibility
of ameliorating the mental, moral, or spiritual condition of the
ryot without giving him security of landed-tenure. If the
Bengal ryot is to be treated as a serf, or a mere squatter or
day-labourer, the missionary, the school-master, even the
Developer of the resources of India, will find their work like
that of Sisyphus—vain and useless.</p>

<p class='c001'>Statistics have proved that in France, Switzerland, Holland,
Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Saxony, the education of the
peasant, along with the security of tenure he enjoys on his
small farms, has encouraged industrious, temperate, virtuous,
and cleanly habits, fostered a respect for property, increased
social comforts, cherished a spirit of healthy and active
independence, improved the cultivation of the land, lessened
pauperism, and has rendered the people averse to revolution,
and friends of order. Even Russia is carrying out a
grand scheme of serf-emancipation in this spirit.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the earnest wish of the writer of these lines that
harmony may be speedily established between the Planter
and the Ryot, that mutual interests may bind the two
classes together, and that the European may be in the
Mofussil the protecting Ægis of the peasants, who may be
able “to sit each man under his mango and tamarind tree,
none daring to make him afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I present “The Indigo Planting Mirror” to the Indigo
Planters’ hands; now, let every one of them, having observed
his face, erase the freckle of the stain of selfishness
from his forehead, and, in its stead, place on it the sandal
powder of beneficence, then shall I think my labour successful,
good fortune for the helpless class of ryots, and preservation
of England’s honor. Oh, ye Indigo Planters! Your
malevolent conduct has brought a stain upon the English
Nation, which was so graced by the ever-memorable names of
Sydney, Howard, Hall, and other great men. Is your desire
for money so very powerful, that through the instigation
of that vain wealth, you are engaged in making holes like
rust in the long acquired and pure fame of the British
people? Abstain now from that unjust conduct through
which you are raising immense sums as your profits; and
then the poor people, with their families, will be able to spend
their days in ease. You are now-a-days purchasing things
worth a hundred rupees by expending only ten;—and you
well know what great trouble the ryots are suffering from that.
Still you are not willing to make that known, being entirely
given up to the acquisition of money. You say, that some
amongst you give donations to schools, and also medicine in time
of need—but the Planters’ donations to schools are more odious
than the application of the shoe for the destruction of a milch
cow, and their grants of medicine are like unto mixing the inspissated
milk in the cup of poison. If the application of a little
turpentine after being beat by Shamchand,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a> be forming a dispensary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>then it may be said that in every factory there is a
dispensary. The Editors of two daily newspapers are filling
their columns with your praises; and whatever other people may
think, you never enjoy pleasure from it, since you know fully the
reason of their so doing. What a surprising power of attraction
silver has? The detestable Judas gave the great Preacher of
the Christian religion, Jesus, into the hands of odious Pilate
for the sake of thirty rupees; what wonder then, if the proprietors
of two newspapers, becoming enslaved by the hope of
gaining one thousand rupees, throw the poor helpless people of
this land into the terrible grasp of your mouths. But <em>misery
and happiness revolve like a wheel</em>, and that the sun of happiness
is about to shed his light on the people of this country,
is becoming very probable. The most kind-hearted Queen Victoria,
the mother of the people, thinking it unadvisable to suckle
her children through maid-servants, has now taken them on
her own lap to nourish them. The most learned, intelligent,
brave, and open-hearted Lord Canning is now the Governor-General
of India; Mr. Grant, who always suffers in the sufferings
of his people, and is happy when they are happy, who
punishes the wicked and supports the good, has taken charge of
the Lieutenant-Governorship, and other persons, as Messrs. Eden,
Herschel, etc., who are, all well-known for their love of truth, for
their great experience and strict impartiality, are continually expanding
themselves lotus-like on the surface of the lake of the
Civil Service. Therefore, it is becoming fully evident that these
great men will very soon take hold of the rod of justice in order
to stop the sufferings which the ryots are enduring from the
great giant <em>Rahu</em>, the Indigo Planter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Sadhu.</i> Master I told you then we cannot live any more
in this country. You did not hear me however. <em>A poor
man’s word bears fruit after the lapse of years.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Goluk.</i> O my child! Is it easy to leave one’s country?
My family has been here for seven generations. The lands
which our fore-fathers rented have enabled us never to acknowledge
ourselves servants of others. The rice which grows,
provides food for the whole year, means of hospitality to guests,
and also the expense of religious services; the mustard seed
we get, supplies oil for the whole year, and, besides, we can sell
it for about sixty or seventy rupees. Svaropur is not a place
where people are in want.—It has rice, peas, oil, molasses
from its fields, vegetables in the garden, and fish from
the tanks;—whose heart is not torn when obliged to leave
such a place? And who can do that easily?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Now it is no more a place of happiness: your garden
is already gone, and your relatives are on the point of forsaking
you. Ah! it is not yet three years since the Saheb took a lease
of this place, and he has already ruined the whole village. We
cannot bear to turn our eyes in the southern direction towards
the house of the heads of the villages (Mandal). Oh! what was
it once, and what is it now! Three years ago, about sixty men
used to make a daily feast in the house; there were ten ploughs,
and about forty or fifty oxen; as to the court-yard, it was
crowded like as at the horse races; when they used to
arrange the ricks of corn, it appeared, as it were, that the
lotus had expanded itself on the surface of a lake bordered
by sandal groves; the granary was as large as a hill; but
last year the granary not being repaired, was on the point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>falling into the yard. Because he was not allowed to plant
Indigo in the rice-field, the wicked Saheb beat the <em>Majo</em> and
<em>Sajo</em> Babus most severely; and how very difficult was it to
get them out of his clutches; the ploughs and kine were sold,
and at that crisis the two Mandals left the village.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Goluk.</i> Did not the eldest Mandal go to bring his brethren
back?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> They said, we would rather beg from door
to door than go to live there again. The eldest Mandal is
now left alone, and he has kept two ploughs, which are nearly
always engaged in the Indigo-fields. And even this person
is making preparations for flying off. Oh, Sir! I tell
you also to throw aside this infatuated attachment (<em>maya</em>)
for your native place. Last time your rice went, and this
time, your honour will go.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Goluk.</i> What honor remains to us now? The Planter
has prepared his places of cultivation round about the
tank, and will plant Indigo there this year. In that case, our
women will be entirely excluded from the tank. And also
the Saheb has said that if we do not cultivate our rice-fields
with Indigo, he will make Nobin Madhab to drink the
water of seven Factories (<i>i. e.</i> to be confined in them).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Has not the eldest Babu gone to the Factory?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Goluk.</i> Has he gone of his own will? The pyeadah
(a servant) has carried him off there.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> But your eldest Babu has very great courage.
On the day the Saheb said, “If you don’t hear the Amin, and
don’t plant the Indigo within the ground marked off, then shall
we throw your houses into the river Betraboti, and shall
make you eat your rice in the factory godown;“ the
eldest Babu replied, “As long as we shall not get the price
for the fifty bigahs of land sown with Indigo last year, we
will not give one bigah this year for Indigo. What do we
care for our house? We shall even risk (pawn) our lives.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><i>Goluk.</i> What could he have done, without he said that?
Just see, no anxiety would have remained in our family if the
fifty bigahs of rice produce had been left with us. And if
they give us the money for the Indigo, the greater part of our
troubles will go away.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Nobin Madhab</span> <em>enters.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>O my son, What has been done?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> Sir, <em>does the cobra shrink from biting the little
child on the lap of its mother on account of the sorrow of the
mother</em>? I flattered him much, but: he understood nothing
by that. He kept to his word, and said, give us sixty
bigahs of land, secured by written documents, and take 50
Rupees, then we shall close the two years’ account at once.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Goluk.</i> Then, if we are to give sixty bigahs for the cultivation
of the Indigo, we cannot engage in any other cultivation
whatever. Then we shall die without rice crops.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> I said, “Saheb, as you engage all your men, our
ploughs, and our kine, every thing, in the Indigo field, only
give us every year through our food. We don’t want hire.”
On which, he with a laugh said, “You surely don’t eat
Yaban’s<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a> rice.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Those whose only pay is a belly full of food are,
I think, happier than we are.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Goluk.</i> We have nearly abandoned all the ploughs; still
we have to cultivate Indigo. We have no chance in a
dispute with the Sahebs. They bind and beat us, it
is for us to suffer. We are consequently obliged to work.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> I shall do as you order, Sir; but my design is
for once to bring action into Court.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><span class='sc'>Aduri</span> <em>enters.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Our Mistress is making noise within; the day is
far advanced; will you not go to bathe, and take your
food. The boiled rice is very near become dry.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> (<em>Standing up.</em>) Sir, decide something about
this, or I shall die. If we give the labour of one-and-a-half of
our ploughs for the cultivation of nine bigahs of Indigo-fields,
our boiling pots of rice will go empty. Now, I am going
away, Sir, farewell, our oldest Babu.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Sadhu goes away.</em>)</div>

not hear a single word and with force he marked off the

<p class='c013'><i>Sadhu.</i> Ray, why did you come so early?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ray.</i> O my brother, the vile Amin has marked off the piece
of ground in Sanpoltola. What shall we eat; and how
shall I pass the year? Ah, our land was bright as the golden
champah.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a> By the produce of only one corner of the field,
we satisfied the mahajans. What shall we eat now, and
what shall our children take? This large family may die
without food. Every morning two <em>recas</em> (nearly 5 lbs) of
rice are necessary. What shall we eat then? Oh, my Ill-fortune!
Ill-fortune (burnt forehead)! what has the Indigo of
this white man done?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> We were living in the hope of cultivating those
bigahs of land; and now, if these are gone, than what use is
there of remaining here any more. And the one or two bigahs
which are become saltish, they yield no produce. Again, the
ploughs are to remain in the Indigo-field; and what can we
do. Don’t weep now; to-morrow we shall sell off the ploughs
and cows, leave this village, and go and live in the Zemindary

He who has given life, will provide also food. Now, what did
you say to the Amin?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ray.</i> What can I say? He began to mark off the ground,
on which it seemed as if he began to <em>thrust burnt sticks</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span><em>into my breast</em>, I entreated, holding him by his feet, and
wanted to give him money; but he heard nothing. He said,

I only punished him with saying, “I shall bring this before
the Court.”</p>

looking on? Go to the house of the Babus, and call the eldest
Babu here.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Amin.</i> (<em>To Sadhu.</em>) Where shalt thou go now? You are
also to go with me. To take advances is not the business of
Ray. We shall have much to bear with if we are to make
signature by cross marks. And because you know how to read
and to write, therefore you must go and make the signatures
in the Factory Account-book.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Sir, do you call this giving advances for Indigo;
would it not be better to call it the <em>cramming down</em> Indigo?<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
Oh! my Ill-fortune, you are still with me. That very blow
through fear of which I fled, I have to bear again. This land
was as the Kingdom of Rama before Indigo was established;
but the ignorant fool is become a beggar, and famine has
come upon the land.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Amin.</i> (<em>To himself observing Khetromani.</em>) This

<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>while I was unable to succeed in getting a peshkar’s (overseer’s)

<p class='c013'><i>Reboti.</i> Oh Amin! have you no wife nor children? Have
you kept only the plough and this beating (<i>márpit</i>)? Did
he not want to drink a little water? By this time he ought to
take a second meal, how can he then, without taking any food,
go to the Saheb’s house which is at such a distance. I ask
for the Saheb’s grace; just let him have some food; and then
take him away. Oh! he is so very much troubled for his wife
and his children. Oh! he is shedding tears, his face is become
dry. What are you doing? To what a burnt-up land
am I come? Destruction has come upon me both in life and
money. Oh! Oh! Oh! I am gone both in life and money.

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Gopi.</i> What fault have I done, my Lord? You are
observing me day by day. I begin to move about early in the
morning, and return home at three o’Clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Again, immediately after taking dinner, I sit down to look over
papers about Indigo advances; and that takes my time to
twelve and sometimes to one o’Clock in the night.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> You, rascal, are very inexperienced. There are no
advances made in Svaropur, Shamanagar, and Santighata
villages. You will never learn without Shamchand, (the
leather strap).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> My Lord I am your servant. It is through favour
only that you have raised me from the <em>peshkári</em> business to
the Dewani. You are my only Lord, you can either kill
me or can cut me in pieces. Certain powerful enemies have
arisen against this Factory; and without their punishment,
there is no cultivation of Indigo.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> How can I punish without knowing them? As
for money, horses, latyals (club-men), I have a sufficiency;
can they not be punished by these? The former Dewan made
known to me about those enemies. You do not. I have
scourged those wicked people, taken away their kine, and
kept their wives in confinement, which is a very severe
punishment for them. You are a very great fool; you know
nothing at all. The business of the Dewan is not that of the
Kayt caste; I shall drive you off, and give the business to a
Keaot.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> My Lord, although I am by caste a Káystha, I do
my work like a Keaot (a shoe-maker). The service which I
have rendered in stopping the rice cultivation and making
the Indigo to grow in the field of the Mollahs, and also to take
(<em>lákhraj</em>) his rent-free lands of seven generations from
Goluk Chunder Bose, and to take away the iron crow<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a> from
the Government; the work I have done for these, I can dare
say, can never be done by a Keaot (a shoemaker). It is my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>ill-fortune only (evil forehead) that I don’t get the least praise
for doing so much.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> That fool, Nobin Madhab, wants the whole account
settled. I shall not give him a single cowrie. That fellow
is very well versed in the affairs of the Court; but I shall
see, how that braggart takes the advances from me.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Sir, he is one of the principal enemies of this
Factory. The burning down of Polasapore would never have
been proved, had Nobin no concern in the matter. That
fool himself prepared the draft of the petition; and it
was through his advice and intrigues that the Attorney
so turned the mind of the Judge. Again, it was through
his intrigues that our former Dewan was confined for two
years. I forbade him, saying, “Babu Nobin, don’t act against
our Saheb; and, especially as he has not burnt your house.”
To which he replied, “I have enlisted myself in order to save
the poor ryots. I shall think myself highly rewarded, if I can
preserve one poor ryot from the tortures of the cruel Indigo
Planters; and throwing this Dewan into prison, I shall have
compensation for my garden.” That braggart is become
like a Christian Missionary; and I cannot say what preparations
he is making this time.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> You are afraid. Did I not tell you at first, you
are very ignorant? No work is to be done through you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Saheb, what signs of fear hast thou seen in
me? When I have entered on this Indigo profession, I have
thrown off all fear, shame, and honor; and the destroying
of cows, of Brahmins, of women, and the burning down of
houses are become my ornaments, and I now lie down in bed
keeping the jail as my pillow (<em>thinking of it</em>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span><i>Gopi.</i> My Lord, this Sadhu Churn is a head ryot;
but through the enticement of Nobin Bose he has been led
to engage in the destruction of Indigo.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> My Lord, I do nothing unjust against your
Indigo, nor am I doing now, neither have I power to do
any thing wrong; willingly or unwillingly I have prepared
the Indigo, and also I am ready to make it this time. But
then, every thing has its probability and improbability; if
you want to make powder of eight inches’ thickness to enter
a pipe half-an-inch thick, will it not burst? I am a poor
ryot, keep only one-and-a-half ploughs, have only twenty
bigahs of land for cultivation; and now, if I am to give nine
bigahs out of that for Indigo, that must occasion my death,
but my Lord, what is that to you, it is only my death.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> The Saheb fears lest you keep him confined in the
godown of your eldest Babu.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Now, Sir Dewanji, <em>what you say is striking
a corpse</em> (useless labor). What mite am I that I shall imprison
the Saheb, the mighty and glorious.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Sadhu, now away with your high flown language;
it does not sound well on the tongue of a peasant; it is like a
sweeper’s broom touching the body.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> Now the rascal is become very wise.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Amin.</i> That fool explains the laws and magistrate’s orders
to the common people, and thus raises confusion. His
brother draws the ploughshare, and he uses the high word
<em>pratápsháli</em> “glorious.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> The child of the preparer of cow-dung balls is
become a Court Naeb (deputy). My Lord, the establishment
of schools in villages has increased the violence of the ryots.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> I shall write to our Indigo Planters’ Association
to make a petition to the Government for stopping the
schools in villages; we shall fight to secure stopping the
schools.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><i>Amin.</i> That fool wants to bring the case into Court.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> (<em>To Sadhu</em>) You are very wicked. You have
twenty bigahs, of which, if you employ nine bigahs for
Indigo, why can’t you cultivate the other nine bigahs for rice.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> My Lord, the debt which is credited to him can be
made use of for bringing the whole twenty bigahs within our
own power.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> (<em>To himself</em>) O oh! <em>the witness for the spirit-seller
is the drunkard?</em> (<em>Openly</em>) If the nine bigahs which
are marked off for the cultivation of the Indigo were worked
by the plough and kine of the Factory, then can I
use the other nine bigahs for rice. The work which is to
be done in the rice-field is only a fourth of that which is
necessary in the Indigo-field, consequently if I am to remain
engaged in these nine bigahs, the remaining eleven bigahs
will be without cultivation.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> You, dolt, are very wicked, you scoundrel
(<em>háramjádá</em>); you must take the money in advance; you
must cultivate the land; you are a very scoundrel (<em>kicks
him</em>). You shall leave off every thing when you meet
with Shamchand (<em>takes Shamchand from the wall.</em>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> My Lord, <em>the hand is only blackened by killing
a fly</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, your beating me only injures you. I am too mean.
We—</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ray.</i> (<em>Angrily</em>) O my brother, you had better stop; let
them take what they can; our very stomach is on the point of
falling down from hunger. The whole day is passed, we have
not yet been able either to bathe or to take our food.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Amin.</i> O rascal, where is your Court now? (<em>Twists his

<p class='c010'><i>Ray.</i> (<em>With violent panting</em>). I now die! My mother!

I am just dead!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> Saheb they have not bathed, neither have they
taken the least food. The members of their family have not
yet washed their faces. If you thus destroy your ryots by flogging
them, who will prepare your Indigo? This Sadhu Churn
prepared the produce of about four bigahs last year with the
greatest trouble possible; and if with such severe beatings
you make such cruel advances to them, that is only your loss.
For this day give them leave, and to-morrow I myself shall
bring them with me, and do as thou do’st bid me.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> Attend to your own business. What concern have
you with another’s affairs. Sadhu, give your opinion quickly,
as it is my dinner time.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> What is the use of waiting for my opinion? You
have already marked off the four bigahs of the most productive
land; and the Amin has, to-day, marked off the remaining
part. The land is marked without my consent, the Indigo
shall be prepared in the same way; and I also agree to
prepare it without taking any advances.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> Do you say my advances are all fictitious you
cursed wretch, bastard and heretic, (<em>beats him</em>).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> (<em>Covers with his hand the back of Sadhu</em>). My
Lord, this poor man has many to support in his family.
Owing to the beating he has got, I think, he will be confined in
bed for a month. Oh! What pains his family is suffering?
Sir, you have also your family. Now, what sorrow would
affect the mind of your wife if you were taken prisoner at
your dinner-time?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> Be silent thou fool, braggart, low fellow, cow-eater.
Don’t think that this Magistrate is like that one of Amaranagara,
that you can, for every word, lay complaints before him,
and imprison the men of the Factory. The Magistrate of

first give me a hand-note to state you have received
the advance for sixty bigahs of land, or else I shall not
let you go this day. I shall break your head with this
Shamchand, you stupid. It is owing to your not taking advances,
that I have not been able to force advances on ten
other villages.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> (<em>With heavy sighs.</em>) O my Mother Earth! separate
yourself that I may enter into you. In my life I never

<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the hair, the hair-string is made. Oh! how beautiful the hair
is; it is like unto that of the Goddess Kali. The face
is as the lotus, always smiling. People may say whatever
they choose to one whom they do not like. I don’t
attend to that. For my part, I feel pleasure when I see the
face of the youngest Bou. I consider the youngest Bou in
the same light, as I do Bipin. The youngest Bou loves me
as her own mother.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Saralota</span> <em>enters with a braid in her hand</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> My sister, just see whether I have been able to
make the under part of this braid? Is it not made?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>Seeing the braid.</em>) Yes, now it is well made.
O! my sister, this part is made somewhat bad; the yellow
does not look well after the red colour.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> I wove it by observing your braid.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> Is the yellow after the red in that?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> No; in that the green is after the red. But
because my green thread is finished, therefore I placed the
yellow after that.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> You were not able, I see, to wait for the
market-day. I see, my sister, every thing is in haste with you.
As it is said, “<em>Hurry is in Brindabun; but as soon as the
desire rises, there is no more waiting.</em>”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Oh! What fault have I committed for that?
Can that be got in the market? At the last market-day, my
mother-in-law sent for it; but that was not got.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> When they write a letter this time to my
husband’s brother, we shall send to ask for threads of various
colours.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Sister, how many days are there still remaining
of this <a id='corr18.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='month.'>month?</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_18.31'><ins class='correction' title='month.'>month?</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>Laughingly.</em>) On the place where the pain
is, the hand touches. As soon as his<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a> College closes, he
shall come home, therefore you are counting the days. Ah!
my sister, your mind’s words are come out.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> I say truly, my sister; I never meant that.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> How very good-natured our Bindu Madhab is?
His words are honey. When we hear his letters read, they
<em>rain like drops of nectar</em>. I never saw such love towards
one’s brother as his; and also his brother shows the greatest
affection for him. When he hears the name of Bindu Madhab,
his heart overflows with joy, and it becomes, as it were,
expanded. Also, as he is, so our Saralota is, (<em>pressing Saralota’s
cheek</em>) Saralota is <em>as honesty itself</em> (<em>Saralota</em>). Have
I not brought with me my huká? I see, that as I
cannot remain without it for a moment, that is the first
thing which I have forgotten to bring along with me.</p>

<p class='c013'>Aduri, will you just go and bring me some ashes of
tobacco?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Where shall I now seek for it?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> It is stuck on the thatched roof of the cook-room,
on the right side of the steps leading into the room.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Then, let me bring the ladder from the threshing
floor; else how can I reach to the roof?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Very well.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> Why can she not understand our mother-in-law’s
word? Don’t you understand what steps are, and what
Dain<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a> signifies?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Why shall I become a Dain; it is my fate. <em>As

<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><em>she is immediately called a Dain.</em> I shall speak of this to
our mistress; am I become so old as to be called a Dain?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>Rising up.</em>) Youngest Bou, sit down, I am

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Aduri, did your husband love you well?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> O young Haldarni, do not raise that word of sorrow
now. Even up to this day, when his face comes before
my mind’s eye, my heart, as it were, bursts with sorrow.
He loved me very much. And he even wanted to give me a
daughter-in-law. He even did not give me time to sleep.
Whenever I felt drowsy, he said, “O my love, are you
sleeping.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Did you call him by his name?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Fie! fie! fie! The husband is one’s Lord. Is it
proper to call him by his name?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Then, how did you call him?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> I used to say, “O! do you hear me.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Soirindri.</i> Who has irritated this fool again?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> She was inquiring after my husband, therefore
I was speaking with her.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>Laughing.</em>) I never saw a greater fool than

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Welcome, my dear sister, I have been sending for you for
these many days; still I see, you don’t get time to come. O
our youngest Bou, here take your Khetra; here she is come.
She was troubling me for these days, saying, My sister
Khetra, of the Ghose family, is come from her father-in-law’s
house; then, why is she not yet coming to our house?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Yes, such is your love towards us. Khetra,
bow down before your aunt.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Khetromani bows down.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Soirindri.</i> Remain with your husband for life; wear
vermillion even in your white hair; let your iron circlet<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
continue for ever, and the next time you go to your father-in-law’s
house, take your new-born son with you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> The young Haldarni speaks most fluently before
me; but this young girl bowed down before her; and she
spoke not a single word.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> Oh! what of that. Aduri, just go and call
our mother-in-law here.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<i>Aduri goes out.</i>)</div>

<p class='c013'>The fool knows not what she says. For how many months
is she<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c009'><sup>[14]</sup></a> with child?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Did I yet express that? The bad turn of my
fortune (<em>broken forehead</em>) is such, that I yet cannot say
whether that is actually the case or not? It is because that
you are very familiar with us, that I tell it you: at the
end of this month she will be in her fourth month.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Khetra, why did you cut off the curls of your
hair?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Khetro.</i> The elder brother of my husband was much
displeased at seeing the curls in my hair. Our mistress said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>that curls agree best with prostitutes and women of rich
families. I was so much ashamed at hearing his words, that
from that very day I cut off my curls.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> Youngest Bou, the shades of evening are
spreading about; just go, my sister, and bring the clothes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div><em>Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Aduri</span> <em>again</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Saralota.</i> (<em>Standing up.</em>) Aduri, come with me; let us
go up, and bring down the clothes.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Let young Haldar first come home, ha! ha! ha!</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Ashamed, Saralota goes away.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>With anger, yet laughing.</em>) Go thou unfortunate

<p class='c013'>Yes, she is come.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> Ghose Bou, art thou come, and hast thou brought
your daughter with you? Yes, you have done well. Bipin
was making noise, therefore, I sent him out and am come
here.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> My mother, I bow down before you. Khetra, bow
down before your grand-mother. (<em>Khetromani bows down.</em>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> Be happy, be the mother of seven sons.
(<em>Coughing aside.</em>) My eldest Bou, just go into the room,
I think my son is up. Oh! my son has no regular time for
bathing, neither for taking food. My Nobin is become very
weak by mere vain thoughts—(<em>aside</em>, “Aduri”) Oh! my
daughter, go in soon, I think, he is asking for water.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>Aside, to Aduri.</em>) Aduri, calling for you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Calling for me, but asking for you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> Thou burnt-faced. Sister Ghose meet me
another day.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Exit Soirindri.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><i>Reboti.</i> O my mother, here is none else. Some great
danger has fallen upon me, that Podi Moyrani came to our
house yesterday.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> Rama! Rama! Rama! who allows that nasty
fool to enter his house? What is left of her virtue? She
has only to write her name in the public notices.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> My mother, but what shall I do! My house is
not an enclosed one. When our males go to take dinner
outside, the house is no more a house; but you may call
it a mart. That strumpet says (I do shrink at the thought),
she says, that the young Saheb is become, as it were, mad
at seeing Khetromani; and wants to see her in the Factory.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Fye! fye! fye! bad smell of the onion! Can
we go to the Saheb. Fye! fye! bad smell of the onion! I
shall never be out any more alone. I can bear every other
thing, but the smell of the onion I can never bear. Fye!
fye! bad smell of the onion!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> But, my mother, is not the virtue of the poor
actual virtue? That fool<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a> says, he will give money, give
grants of lands for the cultivation of rice; and also give
some employment to our son-in-law. Fie! fie! to money. Is
virtue something to be sold? Has it any price? What can
I say? That fool was an agent of the Saheb, or else I would
have broken her mouth with one kick. My daughter is become
thunder-struck from yesterday; and now and then, she is
starting with fear.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> Oh, the Beard! When he speaks, it is like a
he-goat twisting about its mouth. For my part, I would
never be able to go there as long as he does not leave off
his onions and beard. Fie! fie! fie! the bad smell of the
onion.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Mother, again that unfortunate fool says, if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>do not send her with me, I shall take her away by certain
<a id='corr24.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='latyals'>latyals.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_24.1'><ins class='correction' title='latyals'>latyals.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> What more is the Burmese (Mug) power? Can
anyone take away a woman from a house in the British
Dominion?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> O my Mother! Every violence can be committed
in the ryot’s house. Taking away the women, they bring
the men under their power. In giving advances for Indigo
they can do this; only they cannot commit this before one’s
eyes. Don’t you know, my mother, the other day, because
certain parties did not agree to sign a fictitious receipt of
advances, they broke down their house and took away by force
the wife of one of the Babus.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> What anarchy is this! Did you inform Sadhu
of <a id='corr24.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='this.'>this?</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_24.15'><ins class='correction' title='this.'>this?</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> No, my mother. He is already become mad on
account of the Indigo; again, if he hear this, will he keep
quiet? Through excessive anger he will rather smite his head
with the axe.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> Very well, I shall make this known to Sadhu,
through my husband; you need not say anything. What
misfortune is this! The Indigo Planters can do anything.
Then why do I hear it generally said, that the Sahebs are
strict in dispensing justice. Again, my son Bindu Madhab
speaks much in praise of them. Therefore I think that
<em>these are not Sahebs</em>; no, <em>they are the dregs</em>, (<em>Chandál</em>) <em>of
Sahebs</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Respecting another word which Moyrani has said,
I think the eldest Babu has not heard of it—that a new
order has been proclaimed, by which the wicked Sahebs, by
opening a communication with the Magistrate, can throw any
one into prison for six months; again, that they are making
preparations for doing the same with the Babus.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><i>Sabitri.</i> (<em>Sighing deeply.</em>) If this be in the mind of God
it will be.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Many other things she said, my mother; but I
was not able to understand her. Is it the fact, that there is
no appeal when once a person is imprisoned?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> I think, the wretch has aggravated this imprisoning.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> Aduri, be silent a little, my child.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Moreover, the wife of the Indigo Planter, in order
to make her husband’s case strong (<em>pakka</em>), has sent a letter
to the Magistrate, since it is said that the Magistrate hears
her words most attentively.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Aduri.</i> I saw the lady; she has no shame at all. When
the Magistrate of the Zillah (whose name occasions great
terror) goes riding about through the village, the lady also
rides on horseback, with him.—The Bou riding about on a
horse! Because the aunt of Kesi once laughed before the elder
brother of her husband, all people ridiculed her; while
this was the Magistrate of the Zillah.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> I see, wretched woman, thou wilt occasion some
great misfortune one day. Now it is evening, Ghose Bou,
better go home. There is Durga.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Now, I go my mother. I shall buy some oil from
the shop; then there will be light in the house.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Exit Reboti and Khetromani.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Sabitri.</i> Can’t you remain without speaking something at
every word.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> Thou fool, why is she a washerwoman? <em>She is
my Bou of gold, my Goddess of good Fortune</em> (<em>patting
her back</em>). Is there no one in my family excepting you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>bring down the clothes? Can’t you, for one dunda<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a> sit quiet
in one place? Art thou born of such a mad woman? How
did you tear off your cloth. I think you bruised yourself.
Ah, her body is, as it were, a red lotus; and this one
bruise has made the blood to come out with violence.
Now, my daughter, I tell you, never move up and down the
steps in the dark, in such a manner.</p>

    <div><em>Torapa and four other Ryots sitting.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Torapa.</i> Why do they not kill me at once? I can never
show myself ungrateful. That eldest Babu, who has preserved
my caste; he through whose influence I am living here;
he, who by preserving my plough and the cows, is preserving
my life,—shall I by giving false evidence throw the father of
that Babu into prison? I can never do that; I would rather
give my life.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>First Ryot.</i> <em>Before sticks there can be no words</em>; the
stroke of Shamchand is a very terrible thrust. Have we
a film on our eyes; did we not serve our eldest Babu?
But, then, what can we do? If we do not give evidence
they will never keep us as we are. Wood Saheb stood
upon my breast and blood began to fall drop by drop. <em>And
the feet of the horse were, as it were, the hoofs of the ox.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i>Second Ryot.</i> Thrusting in the nails; don’t you know the
nails which are stuck under the shoes worn by the Sahebs?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> (<em>Grinding his teeth with anger.</em>) Why do you
speak of the nails? My heart is bursting with having seen
this blood. What do I say? If I can once get him in the
Vataramari field, with one slap I can raise him in the air;
and at once put a stop to all his “gad dams” and other words
of chastisement.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Third Ryot.</i> I am only a hireling, and keep men under
me. When I heard about the plan which our master
formed, I immediately refused to take any Indigo business
on my hand, saying I shall never work for that.
Why was I then confined in the godown? I thought that
serving under him at this time, I shall be able to make a good
collection and shall be able to attend to my friend; but I am
rotting here in this place for five days, and again I am to go
to that Andarabad.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Second Ryot.</i> I went to that Andarabad once or twice;
as also to that Factory of Bhabnapore, every one speaks good
of the Saheb of that place; that Saheb once sent me to the
Court, then I saw many things pleasant in that place.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> Did he find any fault with you? The Saheb of
Bhabnapore never raises a false disturbance. “<em>By speaking
the truth, we shall ride on horseback.</em>” Had all Sahebs been
of the same character with him, then none would have spoken
ill of the Sahebs.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Second Ryot.</i> My heart over-flows with joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now his torturing is all put a stop to. In his godown
there are now seven persons; one of them a child. The vile
man has filled his house also with kine and calves. Oh,
what robbery is he carrying on!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> As soon as they get a Saheb who is a good man
they want to destroy him. They are holding a meeting to
drive off the Magistrate.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><i>Second Ryot.</i> I cannot understand whether they have
found fault with the Magistrate of this or the other Zillah?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> He did not go to dine in the Factory. They
prepared a dinner for the Magistrate, in order to get him
within their power, but the Magistrate <em>concealed himself
like a stolen cow</em>; he did not go to dinner. He is a
person of a good family. Why should he go to the Indigo
Planters? We have now understood, these Planters are the
low people of Belata.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><i>First Ryot.</i> Then how did the late Governor Saheb go
about all the Indigo Factories, being feasted like a bride-groom
just before the celebration of the marriage.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Did you not see
that the Planter Sahebs brought him to this Factory well-adorned
like a bride-groom?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Second Ryot.</i> I think he has some share in this Indigo
Company.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> No! can the Governor take a share in Indigo
affairs? He came to increase his fame. If God preserve
our present Governor, then we shall be able to procure
something for our sustenance; and the great burden of
Indigo shall no more hang on our shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Third Ryot.</i> (<em>With fear.</em>) I die. If the ghost of this
burden once attack a person, is it true that it does not quit
him soon? My wife said so.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> Why have you brought this my brother here?
For fear of the Sahebs, people are leaving the village; and
my uncle Bochoroddi has formed the following sentence:</p>

in my house; I am become the inhabitant of three villages
at once. I came away to Svaropur, and through the advice
of Bose, I threw away the advance which was offered me.
When my young child was sick I came to Bose to get
from him a little sugar-candy. Ah! how very kind he was;
how agreeable and good-looking in countenance I found
him; and sitting as solemn as an elephant.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> How many bigahs have they given this year?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Fourth Ryot.</i> Last year I prepared ten bigahs; but as
to the price of that, they raised great confusion. This year
again, they have given advances for fifteen bigahs; and I
am doing exactly as they are ordering me; still, they leave
not off insulting me.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>First Ryot.</i> I am laboring with my plough for these two
years, and I have cultivated a little piece of ground. That
piece of ground which I prepared this year, I kept for sesamum;
but one day, our young Saheb, riding on his horse,
came to the place, and waiting there himself, took possession
of the whole piece. How can the ryots live if this is
to continue?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> This is only the intrigue of the wicked Amin.
Does the Saheb know every thing about land? This fool

of land, he immediately gives notice of it to the Saheb. The
Saheb has no want of money, and he has no need for borrowing
money on credit. Then, why is it that the fool does so; if he
have to cultivate Indigo, let him do so; let him buy oxen; let
him prepare ploughs; if he cannot guide the plough himself,
let him keep men under him. What want have you of lands?
If you can cultivate the whole village; and we do not refuse
to give the village. In that case the land can overflow with
Indigo in two years. But he will not do it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Saralota.</i> Now, my dear love with an honest tongue is
not come, and an elephant, as it were, is treading on the
lotus-like heart. I have become hopeless amid very great
hope. In expectation of the coming of the Lord of my life, I
was waiting with greater disquietude of mind than the swallow
(<em>chátak</em>) does when waiting for the drops of rain at the approaching
rainy season. The way in which I was counting the
days exactly corresponded with what my sister said, that each
day appeared, as it were, a year, (<em>deep sigh</em>). The expectation
as to the coming of my husband is now of no effect. The
course of his life itself will prove successful, if the great action
in which he is now engaged, can prove so. Oh, Lord
of my life! We are born women, and cannot even go out to
walk in the garden; we are unable to walk out in the city; can
by no means form clubs for general good; we have no Colleges
nor Courts, nor Brahma Samajs of our own; we have
nothing of our own, to compose the mind, when it is once
disturbed; and, moreover, we can never blame a woman when
she feels any disquietude. O my Lord, we have only one to
depend upon,—the husband is the object of the wife’s thought,
of her understanding, her study, her acquisition, her meeting,
her society; in short, this jewel—the husband—is all to a
virtuous woman. O thou letter! thou art come from the
hand of the dear object of my heart, I shall kiss thee, (<em>kisses
it</em>); in thee is the name of my Lord; I shall hold thee on
my burnt heart, (<em>keeps it on her breast</em>). Ah! how sweet are
the words of my Lord; as often as I read it, my mind is more
and more charmed (<em>reads</em>).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>My Dear Sarala</span>,—<i>In my letter I cannot express
what anxiety my mind feels, to see your sweet face.
O what inexpressible pleasure do I feel when I place
your beautiful (moonlike) face on my breast! I thought
that that moment of happiness is come; but pain immediately
overtook pleasure. The College is closed, but a
great misfortune has come upon me; through the grace of
God, if I be not able to extricate myself from it, I shall
never be able any more to show my face to thee. The Indigo
Planters have secretly brought an accusation against my
father in the Court; their main design being, in some way
or other, to throw him into Jail. I have sent letters, one
after another, to my brother, giving him this information;
and I myself am remaining here with the greatest care possible.
Never disturb yourself with vain thoughts? The merciful
Father must certainly make us successful. My dear, I
have not forgotten the Bengali translation of “Shakespeare;”
it cannot be got now in the shops; but one of my
<a id='corr34.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='friends.'>friends,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_34.19'><ins class='correction' title='friends.'>friends,</ins></a></span> Bonkima by name, has given me one copy. When
I come home, I shall bring it with me. My dear, what
a great source of pleasure is the acquisition of learning!
I am conversing with you, although at such a
great distance, Ah! what great happiness would my
mind have enjoyed if my mother did not forbid you to
send letters to me.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>As to myself—I have a full confidence as to that. If there
be any fault in your character, then who should be an
example of good conduct? Because I am fickle; cannot
sit, for some time quietly in one place, my mother-in-law
calls me the daughter of a mad woman. But, where is my
fickleness now. In the place, where I have opened the letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of my dear Lord, I have spent nearly a fourth part of the
day. The fickleness of the exterior part has now gone into
the heart. As, on the boiling of the rice, the froth rising up
makes the surface quiet, but the rice within is agitated; so
am I now. I have not that smiling face now. A sweet
smile is the wife of happiness; and so soon as happiness dies,
the sweet smile goes along with it. My Lord, when thou shalt
prove successful, every thing shall be preserved; if I am to
see your face disquieted, all sides will be dark unto me. O
my restless mind, wilt thou be not quieted? If you remain
unquiet, that can be suffered. As to your weeping, none can
see it, nor can hear it; but my eyes! you shall throw me into
shame, (<em>rubbing her eyes</em>); if ye are not pacified, I shall not
be able to go out of doors.</p>

The Inspector of this part of the country is a very good man.
How very good a man becomes, if only learning be
acquired. He is young; but in his conversation he has the
experience of years. He has a great desire that a school be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>established in this country. I am also not unwilling
to give money for this purpose; the large Bungalow
which I have, can be a good place for a school; moreover,
what is more happy than to have the boys of one’s own
country to read and write, and study in his own house, this is
the true success of wealth and of labour. Bindu Madhab
brought the Inspector with him, and it is his desire, that all
with one mind try to establish the school. But observing the
unfortunate state of the country, he was obliged to keep
his design to himself; how very mild, quiet, good-natured,
and wise is he become now! Wisdom in younger
years is as beautiful as the fruits in a small plant. In
reading of the sorrow which my brother has expressed in his
letter even the hard stone is melted and the heart of the
Indigo Planter would become soft. I cannot now rise up to

<p class='c013'><i>Nobin.</i> Oh! oh! oh! That which never took place in this
family, has now come to pass. My father is very peaceful,
honest, and of a sincere mind; knows not what disputes and
enmities are; never goes out of the village; trembles with
fear at the name of Court affairs, and even shed tears when he
read the letter. If he is to go to Indrabad, he will turn
mad; and if, to the jail, he will throw himself into the stream.
Ah, such are the misfortunes that are to fall on him, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>I, his son, am living! My mother is not so much afraid as
my father is; she does not lose hope at once; with a firm
mind, she is now invoking God. My deer-eyed is become,
as it were, the deer in my volcano<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c009'><sup>[28]</sup></a>; she is become
mad with fear and anxiety. Her father died in an Indigo
Factory; and her fear, now, is lest the same happens to
her husband. How many sides am I to keep quiet? Is it
proper to fly off with the whole family; or, is it not right
that to do good unto others is the highest virtue? I shall
not turn aside hastily. I see, I am not able to do any
good to Shamanagara; still, what work is there which
is beyond the power of exertion? Let me see what I can do.</p>

thing for one to carry on his work, if his master be the
husband of his sister; the elder Saheb becomes very angry
at this word. But the fellow is very angry with me; at
every word, he shows me the Shamchand. That day he
kicked me with his stockings on. These few days, I see that
his temper is become somewhat mild towards me; since
Goluk Bose is summoned, he has expressed a little kindness.

<p class='c013'>Saheb, tears have now come out of the eyes of Nobin Bose.
Never was he punished more severely. His garden is taken
away from him; the small pieces of land he had are all
included among the lands which are given to Gada, Poda
(<em>low castes</em>); his cultivation is nearly put a stop to;
his magazines are all become empty, and he was sent into
Court twice; in the midst of so many troubles, he still
stood firm; but now he has fallen down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><i>Planter.</i> That rascal was not able to do any thing in
Shamanagara.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Saheb, the Munshis came to him; but he told
them, my mind is not at rest now, “my limbs are become
powerless through weeping for my father, and I am, as it
were, become mad.” On observing the wretched condition of
Nobin, about seven or eight ryots of Shamanagara have all
given up, and all are doing exactly as your Honour is ordering
them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> You are a very good Dewan, and you have
formed a very good plan.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> I knew Goluk Bose to be a coward, and that if he
were obliged to go to Court, he would turn mad. As Nobin has
a great affection for his father, he will of course be punished;
and it was for this reason that I gave the advice to make
the old man the defendant. Also, the plan which your
Honour formed was not the less good. Our Indigo cultivation
has been newly made on the sides of his tank; thus laying
the snake’s eggs in his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> <em>With one stone two birds have been killed</em>;
ten bigahs of land are cultivated with Indigo, and also that
fool is punished. He shed much tears, saying that if Indigo
be planted near the tank we shall be obliged to leave our
habitation; but I said, to cultivate Indigo in one’s habitation
is to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> And the fool brought an action in the Court, on
hearing that reply.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> That will be of no effect; that Magistrate is
a very good man. If the case turn into a civil one it will
never be concluded in less than five years. That Magistrate
is a great friend of mine. Just see, by the new Act, the four
rascals were thrown into prison only by making your
evidence strong. <em>This Act is become the brother of the
sword.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><i>Gopi.</i> Saheb, in order that those four ryots might not
suffer loss in their cultivation, Nobin Bose has given his own
plough, kine, and harrow for the ploughing of their lands;
and he is trying his utmost that their families might not
suffer great trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> When he is required to plough this land, for
which advances are allowed, he says, my ploughs and kine
are less in number. He is very wicked; and now he
is very well punished. Dewan, now you have done very
well, and now I see work may be carried on by you,
without loss.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Saheb, it is your own favour. My desire is, that
advances should be increased every year. But that cannot
be done by me alone; some confident Amin and Khalasis
are necessary. Can the Indigo cultivation be improved by
those who, for the sake of two rupees, occasioned the loss of
the produce of three bigahs of land?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> I have understood it, the rascally Amin occasioned
this confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Saheb, the new habitation, and the taking of advances
of Chunder Goladar are not allowed here. The
Amin once, according to regular custom, threw one rupee
on his ground as an advance. That person, in order
to be allowed to return that rupee even shed tears and came
along with the Amin as far as Ruthtollah, begging him
earnestly to take it back. There he met with Nilkanta
Babu, who has chosen the profession of an Attorney immediately
after leaving the College.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> I know that rascal; he, it is, who writes every
thing concerning me in the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Their papers can never stand before yours, can
by no means bear a comparison; and, moreover, they are as
<em>the earthen bottles for cooling water compared to the jars
of Dacca</em>. But, to bring the newspapers within your influence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>great expense has been incurred. That takes place
according to time; as is said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“According to circumstances, the friend becomes an enemy:</div>
      <div class='line'>The lame ass is sold at the price of the horse.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Planter.</i> What did Nilkanta do?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> He sharply rebuked the Amin; and the Amin
with no little shame brought back that one rupee, with
two rupees more, from Goladar’s house. Chunder Goladar
would have been able very easily to supply the Indigo for
three or four bigahs. Is this the work of a servant? If I
can conduct the Dewanny and the business of the <a id='corr45.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Amin;'>Amin,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_45.11'><ins class='correction' title='Amin;'>Amin,</ins></a></span>
then this kind of ingratitude can be stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> Great wickedness this is; evident ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Saheb, grant pardon for this bad conduct; the
Amin brought his own sister to our younger Saheb’s room.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Planter.</i> Yes! Yes! I know; that rascal and Podi
corrupted our young Saheb. I must give that wicked fool
some instruction very soon. Send him to my sitting room.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Exit Mr. Wood.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Soirindri.</i> Lord of my soul, what is preferable, whether
the ornament or my father-in-law? That, for which thou
art wandering about day and night; that, for which thou hast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>left thy food and sleep; that, for which thou art shedding
tears incessantly; that, for which thy pleasant face has
been depressed; and that which has occasioned thy
head-ache; my dear Lord, can I not for that give away this
my trifling ornament.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> My dear, you can, with <a id='corr46.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='case'>ease</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_46.6'><ins class='correction' title='case'>ease</ins></a></span>, give; but with what
face shall I take it? What great troubles the husband is to
undergo in order to dress his wife: he has to swim in the
rapid stream, to throw himself into the deep ocean, engage
in battles, to climb mountains, to live in the wilderness, and
to go before the mouth of the tiger. The husband adorns
his wife with so much trouble; am I so very foolish as to
take away the ornament from the very same wife. O my
lotus-eyed, wait a little. Let me see this day, and if,
finally I cannot procure it, then I shall take your ornaments
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> O my heart’s love! We are very unfortunate
now; and who is there that shall give you on loan the sum
of Co.’s Rs. 500 at such a time. I am entreating you again,
take my ornaments and those of our youngest Bou, and try
to procure money from a banker. Observing your troubles
the lotus-like young Bou is become sad.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> Ah! my sweet-faced, the cruel words which you
used struck on my heart like arrows of fire. Our youngest
Bou, she is a girl; good clothes and beautiful ornaments are
objects of pleasure to her. What understanding has she
now? What does she know of family business. As our
young Bipin cries when his neck-lace is taken from him in
play, so our youngest Bou weeps when her ornaments
are taken away. Oh, oh! am I formed so mean-spirited
a man? Am I to be so cruel a robber? Shall I deceive a
young girl? This can never be, as long as life exists. The
worthless Indigo Planters even cannot commit such a crime.
My dear, never use such a word before me.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span><i>Soirindri.</i> Beloved of my soul, that pain with which I
told these words, is only known to me and the omniscient
God. What doubt is there, that they are fiery arrows?
They have burst my heart and burnt my tongue, and then
having divided the lips, have entered your heart. It is
with great pain that I told you to take the ornaments
of the youngest Bou. Can there be any pleasure in
the mind, after having observed this your insane wandering,
this weeping of my father-in-law, the deep sighs of my
mother-in-law, the sad face of the youngest Bou, the dejected
countenance of relatives and friends, and the sorrowful
mournings of the ryots? If by any means we can restore
safety, then all shall be safe. My Lord, I do feel the
same pain in giving the ornaments of our youngest Bou, as
if I had to give those of Bipin; but if I give away the ornaments
of Bipin, before giving those of the youngest Bou,
that would prove an act of cruelty to her; since, she might
think that my sister looks on me as a stranger. Can I give
pain to her honest heart by doing this? Is this the work
of the elder sister who is like a mother?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> My dear love! Your heart is very sincere. There
is not a second to you in sincerity in the female race. Is this
my family reduced to this state! What was I, and what am
I now become! The sum of my profits was seven hundred
Rupees. I had fifteen warehouses for corn, sixteen bigahs of
garden land, twenty ploughs and fifty harrows. What great
feasts had I at the time of the Puja; the house filled with
men, feasting the Brahmins, gifts to the poor, the feasting of
friends and relations, the musical entertainments of the
Voishnabas, and also pleasant theatrical representations. I
have expended such large sums, and even given as donations
one hundred Rupees. Being so rich, now I am obliged
to take away the ornaments of my wife, and the wife
of my young brother. What affliction? God, thou didst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>give these, and thou hast taken them again. Then, what
sorrow?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> My dear, when I see you weep, my life
itself weeps (<em>tears in her eyes</em>). Was there so much pain in
my fate; am I thus destined to see such distress in my Lord?
Do not prevent me any more. (<em>Takes out the amulet.</em>)</p>

destruction of this land is very near. What a brutal Act is

passed the Act? What misery can the country suffer if those
who are to carry out the Act, do it with impartiality? Ah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>by this Act how many persons are suffering in prison-houses
without a fault! It bursts the heart to see the miseries of
their wives and children; the pots for boiling rice on the
hearths are remaining as they are; the several kinds of grain
in their yards are being dried up; their kine in the rooms
are all remaining bound in their places; the cultivation of the
fields is not fully carried out, the seeds are not sown, and
the wild grass in the rice fields is not cut off. What further
prospects are there in the present year? All are crying aloud,
with the exclamation, Where is my lord? Where is my
father? Some Magistrates are dispensing justice with proper
consideration; in their hands this Act is not become the rod
of death. Ah! Had all Magistrates been as just as the
Magistrate of Amaranagara is, then could the harrow fall on
the ripe grain and the locusts destroy the fields? Had that
been the case, would I ever have been thrown into
so many dangers? O, thou Lieutenant-Governor! had’st
thou engaged men of the same good character as thou had’st
enacted laws, then the country would never have been
miserable. O, thou Governor of the land! had’st thou made
such a regulation, that every plaintiff, when his case is proved
false, shall be put in prison, then the jail of Amaranagara
would have been crowded with Indigo Planters; and
they would never have been so very powerful. Our Magistrate
is transferred, but our case is to continue here to the
end; and that will occasion our ruin.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Khetra.</i> My aunt, don’t speak of such things to me; I
can give up my life, but my chastity never; cut me in
pieces, burn me in the fire, throw me into the water, and
bury me under ground; but as to touching another man that
can I never do. What will my husband think?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Podi.</i> Where is your husband now, and where are you?
This shall no one know. Within this night, I shall bring you
back with me to your mother.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Khetra.</i> Very well, the husband may not know it—but
God above will know it, and I shall never be able to throw dust
in his eyes. Like the fire of the brick-kiln it will still burn
within my breast, and the more my husband shall love me for
my constancy, the more my soul shall be tortured. Openly or
secretly, I never can take a paramour.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Podi.</i> My child, come, come to the Saheb. Whatever you

<p class='c010'><i>Planter Rose.</i> To speak to me is <em>throwing pearls at the
hog’s feet</em>. Ha, ha, ha, we Indigo Planters, are become the
companions of Death; can our Factories remain, if we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>pity? By nature, we are not bad; our evil disposition has
increased by Indigo cultivation. Before, we felt sorrow in
beating one man; now, we can beat ten persons with the
Ramkant (leather strap), making them senseless; and immediately
after, we can, with great laughter, take our dinner
or supper.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torap.</i> I will swim over the stream to my house,
this night. What more shalt thou hear of my fate; I
broke down the window of the Attorney’s stable, and immediately
ran off to the Zemindary of Babu Bosonto, and
then in the night came to my wife and children. This
Planter has stopped every thing; has he left any means
for men to live by ploughing? How very terrible are
the thrusts of the Indigo? Again, the advice is given to
serve for it. Now, Sir, where are your kicks with your
shoes on, and your beating on the head? (<em>Thrusts him
with his knees</em>).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin.</i> Torap, what is the use of beating him? We ought
not to be cruel, because they are so; I am going.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Torap.</i> Do you want to show such ill-usage and bad
conduct? Speak to your old father and carry on your
business by mutual consent; how long shall your force of
hand continue? You shall not be able to do anything, when
I shall fly. There is no abuse more horrid than to say,
Die! When your destiny shall decide, you shall have to enter
the Factory of the Tomb. Just settle our eldest Babu’s
account of the last year; and take what he consents to sow
of Indigo in the present year. It is owing to you that
they have fallen into a state of confusion. It is not merely
to load one with advances, but cultivation is necessary. Good
evening, our young Saheb. Now, I go. (<i>Throws him about,
lying on his back, and flies off.</i>)</p>

Why didst not thou also give me a summons? I would have
gone to the zillah with my husband and my child; that
would have been far better than remaining in this desert.
Ah! my husband always remains in the house, never goes
out to another village even on invitation. Is he destined to
suffer so much?—The peadahs taking him away, and he himself
to go to the jail. Bhagavati, my mother! was there so much
in thy mind? Ah! he says, that he can never sleep, but
in a room very long and broad; he eats only the boiled
Atapa rice;<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c009'><sup>[29]</sup></a> he takes the food prepared by no other hand
but that of the eldest Bou. Ah! he brought out blood out
of his breast by severe slaps; he made his eyes swollen
by tears; and at the same time, he took his leave, he said this
is my going to the side of the Ganges<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c009'><sup>[30]</sup></a> (<i>weeps</i>). Nobin says,
Mother call on Bhagavati. I must return home having
gained my object and bring him home also. Ah! the face of
my son, like unto that of gold, is blackened; what great
troubles for the collection of money! Wandering about without
rest, his brain is become like a whirl-pool. Lest I give
away the ornaments of the Bous, my son encourages me,
saying, My mother, what want of money? What large
sum will be necessary for this case? How shall my
child grieve, if my ornaments be given in mortgage for our
suit on small portions of land! He says, as soon as I get a
small sum of money, I shall immediately bring back the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>ornaments. My son has courage in his tongue and tears in
his eyes. Ah! he started with tears in his eyes. My dear
Nobin, in this heat of the sun, went to Indrabad; and I,
a great sinner, remained confined in my room. Is this the

<span class='sc'>Bindu Madhab</span>, <em>the Attorneys of the Plaintiff and the
Defendant, the Agent, Nazir, a Bailiff, Servants, Ryots, &amp;c.,
standing</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Defendant’s Attorney.</i> May the prayer in this application
be granted. (<i>Gives the application to the Sheristadar.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magistrate.</i> Very well; read it. (<i>Speaks with Mr.
Wood, and laughs.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sheristadar.</i> (<i>To the Defendant’s Attorney.</i>) You have
written here what equals the length of the Ramayan. Can
the petition be read without its being in abstract? (<i>Turns to
another page of the application</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magistrate.</i> (<i>Having spoken with Mr. Wood, and concealing
his laughter</i>). Read clearly.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sheristadar.</i> In the absence of the defendant and his
attorneys, the evidence is already taken from the witnesses of
the plaintiff. We pray that the witnesses of the plaintiff be
again called.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Plaintiff’s Attorney.</i> My Lord, it is true that attorneys
are given up to lying, deceiving, and forgery; they easily
forge and tell lies, and are incessantly engaged in immoral
actions. They lead astray married women; and then they
themselves enjoy their houses and every thing else. The
Zemindars hate the attorneys; but for the effecting their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>special purposes, they call them, and give them a seat on
their couch. My Lord, the very profession of the attorneys is a
cheating one. But the attorneys of the Indigo Planters can never
deceive. The Indigo Planters are Christians; falsehood is accounted
a great sin in the Christian Religion. Stealing, licentiousness,
murder, and other actions of that nature are also
looked upon as hateful in that religion not taking evil actions
into consideration, even forming evil designs in the mind
dooms a man to burn in the fire of hell. The main aim of
the Christian Religion is to show kindness, to forgive, to be
mild and to do good unto others; so, it is by no means probable
that the Indigo Planters, who follow such a true and
pure religion, ever give false evidence. My Lord, we do
serve such Indigo Planters; we have reformed our character
according to theirs, and even, if we desire, we can, by no
means, teach the witness anything false; since if the Sahebs,
the lovers of truth, find the least fault in their servants,
they punish them according to the rules of justice. The Amin
of the Factory, the witness of the defendant, is an example
of that. Because he deprived the ryot of his advances, the
kind Saheb drove him from his office; and being angry on account
of the cries of the poor ryot, he also beat him severely.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood the Planter.</i> (<em>To the Magistrate.</em>) Extreme provocation!
Extreme provocation!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Plaintiff’s Attorney.</i> My Lord, many questions were put
to my witnesses; had they been witnesses who were prepared
ones (perjured) they would have been caught by those
very questions. The lawyers have said, “The Judge is as the
advocate of the defendant,” consequently the questions to be
put by the defendant, are already asked by your Honour.
Therefore, there is no probability of any advantage to the defendant,
if the witnesses be brought here again; but on the
other hand, it will prove very disadvantageous to them.
Honored Sir, the witnesses are poor people who live by holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the plough. By the plough they maintain their wives
and children; their fields become ruined if they do not remain
there for the whole day; so much so, that because it
proves a loss to them if they come home, their wives bring
boiled rice and refreshments bound in handkerchiefs to them
in the fields, and make them eat that. It proves an entire
loss to the ryots to come away from the fields for one day;
and at such a time, if they be brought to such a distant
part of the zillah by summons, then the labours of the whole
year will go for nothing. Honored Sir, Honored Sir, do as
you think just.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magistrate.</i> I don’t see any reason for that (<em>as advised by
Mr. Wood</em>). There seems no necessity for that.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Defendant’s Attorney.</i> My Lord, the ryots of no village
take the advances of the Indigo Planters with their full
consent. The Indigo Planter, accompanied by the Amins and
servants, or his Dewan, goes on horse-back to the field, marks off
the best pieces of land, and orders the preparation of the Indigo.
Then the owner of the land brings the ryots to the Factory,
and having made known to them the particulars of the
matter, takes their signatures for the advances. The ryots,
taking the money in advance, come home with tears in
their eyes; and the day on which any of them comes home
with the money, his house, becomes filled, as it were, with
the tears of persons weeping for the death of a relative or
friend. On the payment of the Indigo to the Indigo Planter,
even if the latter have something still to pay to the farmers
above the sum of the advances as the price of that
article, yet they keep it in their Account-books that the farmers
have still something to pay. The ryots, when they have
once taken the advance, will suffer pain for not less than
seven generations. The sorrow which the ryots endure in the
preparation of the Indigo is known only to themselves and
the Great God, the Preserver of the poor. Whenever some sit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>together, they converse about the advances and inform each
other of their respective sums; and also try how to save themselves.
They have no necessity for forming plans and mutually
taking the advice of each other. Of themselves they are become
as mad as the dog who received a blow on the
head. The witnesses gave evidence that the ryots were
willing to prepare Indigo; but that the person who has engaged
me had, by advice and intimidation, stopped their engaging
in the preparation of Indigo. This is a very striking
and an evident forgery. Honored Sir, once more bring them
before the Bench, and your servant will by two questions disclose
the falsity of their evidence. I do acknowledge, that Nobin
Madhab Bose, the son of Goluk Chunder Bose, who engaged
me, tried his utmost to extricate the helpless ryots from the
hands of the giant-like Indigo Planters. I do acknowledge
this. He also proved himself successful in stopping the
tyranny of Mr. Wood; which is known fully by the case
which was brought here for the burning of the village of
Polaspore. But Goluk Chunder Bose is of a very peaceful
character; he fears the Indigo Planters more than the tigers,
never engages in any quarrels; at no time injures another, and
even is not courageous enough to save another from danger.
My Saheb, that Goluk Chunder Bose is a man of a good
character, is known to all persons in the zillah, and can be
known even by enquiring of the Amlas of the Court.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Goluk.</i> Honored Sir, the whole sum due for my Indigo of
the last year was not paid; still only through fear of coming
into Court, I consented to take the advance for sixty bigahs of
land. My eldest son said, “Father, we have other ways of
living; the loss in Indigo for one year or two might stop feasts
and religious ceremonies, but will not produce want of food.
But those who entirely depend on their ploughs; what means
have they? Losing this case if we be obliged again to engage
in the Indigo cultivation, all will be obliged to do the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>same afterwards.” He said this is a wise man; and consequently
I told him to make the Saheb, by entreaties and supplications,
to agree to fifty bigahs. The Saheb said nothing,
neither Yes nor No; and secretly made preparations to bring
me in my old age, to gaol. I know that the only way to get
happiness is to keep the Sahebs contented; the country is the
Saheb’s, the Judges are their brothers and friends; and is it
proper to do anything against them? Extricate me, and I
make this promise, that if I cannot prepare the Indigo
from want of ploughs and kine, I will annually give the
Saheb Co.’s Rs. 100 in the place of that. Am I a person to
tutor the ryots? Do I meet them?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Defendant’s Attorney.</i> Honored Sir, of the four ryots who
came as witnesses, one is of the Tikiri caste; he has no
knowledge of what a plough is; he has no lands and no rents
to pay; has no kine and no cow-house; and this can be best
known by proper examination. Kanai Torofdar is a ryot of
a different village; and as to our Babu he has no acquaintance
with him. For these reasons we do pray that these men be
brought again. The legislators have said, before the decision,
the defendant ought to be supplied with all proper means.
Saheb, if this my prayer be granted, I shall have no more
reasons for complaint.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Plaintiff’s Attorney.</i> Saheb.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magistrate.</i> (<em>Writes a letter.</em>) Speak, speak; I am not
writing from hearsay.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Plaintiff’s Attorney.</i> Saheb, if at this time, the ryots be
brought here they will suffer great loss; else, I, also, would
have prayed for their being brought here again, since the
offences of the defendant which are already proved, may
receive stronger confirmation. Sir, the bad character of
Goluk Chunder Bose is known throughout the country;
he who benefits him, in return, receives injuries. The
Indigo Planters crossing the immeasurable ocean have come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>to this land, and have brought out its secret wealth; have
done great benefit to the country, have increased the royal
treasure, and have profited themselves. What place, besides
the prison, can best befit a person who thus opposes the great
actions of these noble men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Chaprasi.</i> Sir! (<em>Comes to the Saheb.</em>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magistrate.</i> (<em>Advises with Mr. Wood.</em>) Give this to Mrs.
Wood. Tell the Khansamah, the Saheb, who is come here,
will not go to-day.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sheristadar.</i> Sir, what orders are to be written?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magistrate.</i> Let it remain within the <em>Nathi</em> or Court
documents.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sheristadar.</i> (<em>Writes.</em>) It is ordered that it remains within
the <em>Nathi</em> (<em>signed by the Magistrate</em>). Saheb, thou hast not
yet made a signature on the orders to the reply of the
defendant.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magistrate.</i> Read it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sheristadar.</i> It is ordered, that the defendant is to give

restoration of life to them. Babu Nobin Chunder is of a
brave spirit, does good to others, is very munificent, a great
improver of learning, and also of a patriotic mind; but the
mist of the cruel Indigo Planters withered all his good
qualities in the bud.</p>

<p class='c013'>Welcome, Sir!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pundit.</i> My body is naturally somewhat of a warm nature.
I cannot hear the sunshine. The heat of the sun
makes me, as it were, mad in the months of March, April,
and May. I had a very severe head-ache for a few days; and
was not able to attend Bindu Madhab at all.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>D. Inspector.</i> The Vishnu Toila (a kind of oil) can do you
some good. The oil is prepared for Babu Vishnu, and to-morrow
I shall send some to your house.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pundit.</i> I am much obliged to you for that. A man of
a healthy constitution becomes mad by teaching children;
such am I.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>D. Inspector.</i> Why don’t we see our elder Pundit any more?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><i>Pundit.</i> He is now trying some means to leave this
doggish service. While his good son is making some acquisition
of property, the family will be maintained like that of
a King. It does not seem good for him now to go to and
come from the College looking with his books under his arm
like a bull bound to the cart. He is now of age.</p>

You did not hear it; at Christmas he spent ten days continually
in that Factory. The ryot is to have justice from him!

Magistrate such is the Commissioner.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Bindu.</i> Sir, you know not the Commissioner; and, therefore,
you spoke thus of him. The Commissioner is very
impartial, and is always desirous of the improvement of the
natives.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pundit.</i> Whatever that be; now if, through the blessing

Nobin Madhab by the name of “Bhima<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c009'><sup>[33]</sup></a> of Svaropur;” is

<p class='c010'><i>Bindu.</i> As to our estates and possessions, we have lost
every thing; at last, our father has left us beggars (<em>weeps</em>);
how can studying be any more carried on?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pundit.</i> The Indigo Planters have taken away the all
of Bindu Madhab and his family.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Doctor.</i> I have heard of these Planters from the
Missionaries and also I have seen them myself. Once as I
was coming from a certain Planter’s Factory at Matanagara,
while I was sitting in a village, two ryots of the place
were passing by the side of my palanquin; one of
them had some milk with him, which I wanted to
buy. Immediately, one whispered to the other, “The
Indigo giant, the Indigo giant.” Then having left the
milk, they ran off. I asked another ryot, and he said,
that these persons ran off for fear of being compelled to take
advances for Indigo; and as I had taken the advance, what
reason is there for going to his godown. I understood, he
took me for a planter; I gave the milk into that ryot’s hand,
and went away from the place.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><i>D. Inspector.</i> A certain Missionary was passing through a
village within the concern of Mr. Vally. As soon as the
ryots saw him, they began to cry aloud, “The Indigo ghost
is come out, the Indigo ghost is come out;” and having left
that path, flew into their own houses. But as the ryots
found, by and by, the bounty, mildness, and forgiving
temper of these gentlemen, they began to wonder; and as
much as the Missionaries showed heartfelt sorrow for the tortures
which the poor people suffered from the Indigo
Planters, so much the more they began to love them, and to
have faith in them. Now the ryots say to each other, “All
bamboos are of one tuft; but of one is made the frame of the
Goddess Durga, and of another the sweepers basket.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pundit.</i> Let us take away the dead body.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Gopi.</i> How did you get so much information?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Cowherd.</i> We are their neighbours; day and night,
we go to their house. Whenever we are in want of any thing,
either a little salt or a ladle of oil, we immediately go to them
and bring it; if the child cry, we bring a little molasses from
them and give it; we are getting our support for nearly
seven generations from the Bose family; and can’t we
get information about them?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Where was Bindu Madhab married?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Cowherd.</i> Oh, it is in a village to the west of Calcutta.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>In which they wanted to have the Kaistas<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c009'><sup>[34]</sup></a> wear the poita.
We cannot satisfy all the Brahmins now in existence in a great
feast, and still they wanted to increase the number. The father-in-law
of our young Babu is greatly respected. The Judge or
Magistrate when they come to him take off their hats.
Do such men give their daughters to men of these places?
Observing the improvements in learning made by our young
Babu, they did not care about the village belonging to ryots.
People say that the women in cities are showy, and
that there is no distinction between those who live within
the house and those who live in the bazar.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c009'><sup>[35]</sup></a> But we do
not at all find a young woman of a mild temper as the Bou
of the Bose family is. The mother of Goma goes to their
house every day, still, although she has been married for
nearly five years, she has never seen her face. We saw her
only on that day when she came here. We thought
that the Babus in the city keep company with the Europeans;
therefore they have brought their females into public
like English ladies.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> But the Bou is always engaged in attending on
her mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Cowherd.</i> Dewanji, what shall I say? The mother of
Goma says, I heard a report that, had not the youngest Bou
been in the house when the news of Nobin being bound by the
rope and thus killed came, the mistress of the family would
have died. We heard also that the women in the city treat
their husbands as sheep (slaves) and murder their parents by
not giving them any support; but observing this Bou, I now
know that it is a mere report.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> I think, the mother of Babu Nobin Chunder also
loves her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><i>Cowherd.</i> I don’t see any one in the world whom she
does not love. Ah! She is an Annapurnah<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c009'><sup>[36]</sup></a> (full of rice).
But have you kept the rice that she shall be full of it?<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c009'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The

<p class='c010'><i>Cowherd.</i> What can I do? Is it my desire to sit in
the Factory and abuse the Sahebs?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> I am very sorry that I have destroyed this man
of great honour by a false law-suit. I have also felt great
pain on hearing of Nobin’s severe head-ache and the miserable
condition of his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Cowherd.</i> <em>It is the cold attacking a frog.</em><a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c009'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Dewanji,
don’t be angry with me, I am as a mad goat; shall I prepare
the tobacco?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> This stupid fellow of Nanda’s family is very senseless.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Cowherd.</i> The Sahebs are doing all: <em>they themselves are
blacksmiths and at the same time the cimeter; where they
make one to fall, there they themselves also fall</em>. If
ruin come upon these Saheb’s Factories, then the people of
the villages save themselves by bathing.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c009'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> You are very foolish. I don’t want to hear any
more? Go out, the Saheb will come very soon.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Cowherd.</i> Now, I am going. You must attend to my
milk bill, and also give me one rupi to-morrow. We shall
go to bathe in the Ganges.</p>

themselves to sow Indigo on fifty bigahs of land, although they
did not get the full price for the last year. Yet the Sahebs
are not satisfied; these disputes arose only for certain pieces
of grounds; and it would have been good for Nobin Bose
to have given them these—<em>to keep the goddess Sitola<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c009'><sup>[41]</sup></a> well-pleased

    <div><em>Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Mr. Wood</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Wood.</i> There will be a great quarrel at Matanagara:
and all the latyals will be there. Let no one hear this?
For this place, make a  collection of ten of the poda caste of
(Surki) brickpowder makers or sellers. I, Mr. Rose, and
you are to go there. The fool while he has taken his cacha<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c009'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
will not be able to increase the row greatly. He is sick;
then how can he go to bring assistance from the Darogah.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> The extreme weakness to which these are reduced,
makes it unnecessary to bring any <em>surkiwallá</em> among the
Hindus, for  a person to die with a rope round his neck,
especially within a prison is very disgraceful; so he is
greatly punished by this occurrence.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><i>Wood.</i> You do not understand this. The rascal is become
very happy on the death of his father. He took the advances
for a long time only through fear of his father;
now that fear is gone, and he will do as he likes. The
rascal has given a bad name to my Factory, and I will imprison
him to-morrow and keep him along with Mojumdar.
If the Magistrate be of the same character with him
of Amaranagara, the wicked people will be able to do every
thing.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> With respect to what they planned about the case of
Mojumdar, I cannot say how very terrible it would have
been, had not Nobin Bose fallen into this great danger. I
cannot say what they still will do? Moreover, as the
Magistrate, who is coming, we have heard, is on the
side of the ryots; and when he comes to the villages, he
brings along with him his tents.—Observing this, we may say,
it might occasion great confusion, and also it is somewhat
fearful.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> You are always puzzling me with speaking of
fear; the Indigo Planters, in nothing whatever, have any
fear. If you don’t desire it, leave your business, thou great
fool!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Sir, fear comes on good grounds. When the former
Dewan was put in prison, his son came to ask for the
last six months’ salary of his father. On which you told him
to make an application. Then, on his making the application,
you again said the salary cannot be given before the accounts
are closed. Honored Sir, is this the judgment on a servant
when he is put in prison?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> Did not I know this? Thou stupid, ungrateful
creature! What becomes of your salaries? If you did not
devour the price of the Indigo, would there be any deadly
Commission? Would the poor ryots have gone to the
Missionaries with tears in their eyes? You, rascal, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>destroyed every thing. If the Indigo lessen in quantity, I
shall sell your houses and indemnify myself; thou arrant
coward, hellish knave!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Sir, <em>we are like butcher’s dogs: we fill our bellies
with the intestines</em>. Had you, Sir, taken the Indigo from
the ryots in the very same way as the (Mahajans) factors take
the corn from their debtors, then the Indigo Factories would
never have suffered such disgrace; there would have been
no necessity for an overseer and the khalasis, and the people
would never have reproached me with saying “Cursed
Gopi! Cursed Gopi!”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Wood.</i> Thou art blind, thou hast no eyes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div><em>Enter an Umadar</em> (<em>an Apprentice</em>).</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I have seen with my own eyes (<em>applying his hand to his
own eyes</em>) the Mahajans go to the ricefield, and quarrel
with the ryots (their debtors). Ask this person.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Apprentice.</i> Honored Sir, I can give many examples of
that. The ryots say, it is through the grace of the Indigo
Planters only that we are preserved from the hands of the
Mahajans.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> (<em>Aside, to the Apprentice.</em>) My child, it is vain
flattery. No employment is vacant now. (<em>To Mr. Wood</em>)
It is true that the Mahajans go to the rice-fields and dispute
with the ryots; but if your Honor had been acquainted
with the mysterious intention of the Mahajans in going to
the fields and raising disputes, you would never have compared
with the going of the Mahajans to the fields, the
punishment of the poor with Shamchand resembling the
tortures which Lakhman, the son of Sumitra, suffered by
the Sacti-sela,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c009'><sup>[43]</sup></a>—while they are without food.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span><i>Wood.</i> Very well, explain it to me. There must be some
reason why these fools speak to us of every thing else; but
of the Mahajans they don’t say a single word.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gopi.</i> Honored Sir, these debtors, whatever sum of money
they require for the whole year, they take from the Mahajans,
and that quantity of rice which is necessary for them for
that time, they also take from their creditors. At the end
of the year, the debtors clear their debts either by selling the
tobacco, sugar-cane, sesamum, and other things which they
have, and then giving the sum collected to their creditors with
the interest on the sum for the time; or by giving those very
articles according to the market price: and of the corn
which grows, they send to the Mahajans’ houses, a part half-prepared.
That which remains proves sufficient for the expenses
of the family for three or four months. If through
famine or any improper expenses of the debtors, there fall
any arrears in their supplies, the remainder of the debt is
carried into the new account-book. Then, by and by, the remainder
is filled up. The Mahajans never bring an action
against their debtors; consequently the falling into arrears
appears to them, as it were, a present loss. I suppose
the Mahajans for that reason, sometimes go to the fields,
observe the preparation of the rice and also enquire
whether the extent of land for which the debtors
have asked the revenue from them, is all cultivated
with grain. Some inexperienced persons, taking under
false pretences a larger sum than is necessary, and thus being
burdened with heavy debts, cause losses on the part of the
Mahajans and also themselves suffer great trouble. The Mahajans
go to the fields for stopping these, and not like “Indigo

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Priest.</i> Oh God, hast thou killed such a man! Hast thou
stopped the provision of so many men! We do not find any
such symptom that our eldest Babu will sit up again.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> God’s will. He can give life to a dead man.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Priest.</i> On the third day, Bindu Babu, according to the
Shastras, celebrated the offering of the funeral cake (<em>pindadán</em>)
on the banks of the Ganges; it is only through the entreaties
of his mother that preparations are being made for the monthly
ceremony (<em>shradh</em>). It was determined that after the celebration
of the ceremony, their dwelling place is to be
removed; and I also heard that they will no more meet with
that cruel Saheb; then why did he go there to-day?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Our eldest Babu has no fault, nor has he any
want of judgment. Our madam and the eldest Bou forbad
him many times. They said, “During the days we are
to remain here, we will bathe with the water of the well, or
Aduri will bring the water from the tank; we shall have no
trouble.” The eldest Babu said “With a present of 50 Rupis,
I shall fall at the Saheb’s feet, and thus stop the cultivation
of the Indigo on the side of the tank, and shall speak nothing
of the dispute in such a dangerous time.” With this intention
our eldest Babu took me and Torap with him, and going
there with tears in his eyes, said to the Saheb, “Saheb, I bring
you a present of 50 Rupis; only for this year, stop the
cultivation of the Indigo in this place: and if this be not
granted, take the money, and delay that business only till the
time when the ceremony is to be performed.” There is sin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>even in repeating the answer which the wretch gave, and the
hairs of our body stood on an end. The rascal said, “Your
father was hung in the jail of the Yabans<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c009'><sup>[52]</sup></a> with thieves and
robbers; therefore keep your money for the sacrifice of many
bulls which are necessary for his ceremony.” Then placing his
shoe on one of the eldest Babus knees, he said “This is the
gift for your father’s ceremony.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Priest.</i> Narayan! Narayan.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c009'><sup>[53]</sup></a> (<em>Placing his hand on his
ears</em>).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Instantly the eyes of the eldest Babu became
red like blood, his whole body began to tremble, he bit his
lips with his teeth and then remaining silent for a short time
gave the Saheb a hard kick on the breast, so that he fell
on the ground upside down like a bundle of <i>bena</i> (a certain
grass). Kes Dali, who is now the jamadar of the Factory, and
other ten surkiola immediately stood round him. The eldest
Babu had once saved these from the hands of robbers; so they
felt a little ashamed to raise their hand against him. Mr. Wood
gave a blow to the jamadar, took the stick out of his hand
and smote with it the head of the eldest Babu. The head
was cracked, and he fell down senseless on the ground; I tried
much, but was not able to go into that crowd. Torapa was
observing this from a distance: and as soon as the men
stood round the eldest Babu, he with violence rushed into
this crowd like an obstinate buffalo, took him up, and
flew off.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> I was told “to stand at a distance, lest they take
me away by force.” The fools hate me very much; do I
hide myself when there is a tumult? If I had gone a little
before, I would have brought the Babu safe, and would have
sacrificed two of those rascals in the Durgah of Borkat Bibi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>(the temple of Benediction). My whole body is shrunk on observing
the head of the Babu; then, when shall I kill
these? Oh! oh! the eldest Babu saved me so many times,
but I was not able to save him once. (<em>Beats his forehead
and cries.</em>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Priest.</i> I see a wound from a weapon on his breast.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> As soon as Torapa rushed into the crowd, the
young Saheb struck the Babu with the sword. Torapa saved
the Babu by placing his hand in front of his own, which
was cut, and there was the sign of a slight bruise on the
Babu’s breast.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Priest.</i> (<em>Deeply thinking for some time, reads</em>).</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Man knows this for certain, that understanding and
goodness are necessary in the friend, the wife, and in
servants.</em>” I do not see a single person in this large house;
but a person of a different caste and of another village, is
weeping near the Babu. Ah! the poor man is a day-laborer,
and his very hand is cut off. Why is his face all daubed
over with blood?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> When the young Saheb struck his hand with
the sword, like an ichneumon making a noise when its
tail is cut off, he in agony from the pain of his hand
flew off after seizing with a bite the nose of the elder
Saheb.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Torapa.</i> That nose I have kept with me, and when the
Babu will rise up alive again I will show him that (<em>shows
the nose cut off</em>). Had the Babu been able to fly off himself,
I would have taken his ears; but I would not have killed
him, as he is a creature of God.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Priest.</i> Justice is still alive. The Gods were saved from
the injustice of Ravana, when the nose of Surpanaka was
cut off: shall not the people be saved from the tyranny
of the Indigo Planters by the cutting off of the elder
Saheb’s nose?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span><i>Torapa.</i> Let me now hide myself; I shall fly off in the
night. That fool will overturn the whole village on account
of his nose.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><em>Sadhu.</em> So very weak is our madam become by the
death of her husband, that there is no doubt she will die, when
she sees Babu Nobin in this condition. I applied so much
water, rubbed my hand over the head so long; but nothing
is bringing him to his senses again. You, Sir, call him once.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Priest.</em> Eldest Babu! Eldest Babu! Nobin Madhab!
(<em>with tears in his eyes</em>) Guardian of ryots! Giver of food!
moving his eyes now! Ah! The mother will die immediately.
When she heard of his being bound with ropes above ground,
she resolved not to take the rice of this sinful world for ten
days. This is the fifth; this morning, Nobin Madhab taking
hold of her shoulders shed much tears and said, “Mother,
if thou dost not take food this day, then I shall never
take the rice with the clarified butter; thus placing the sin
of disobedience to the mother on my head; but shall remain
without food.” On which the mother kissing her son
Nobin, said, “My son, I was a queen, now am I become the
mother of a king. I would never have been sorry, had I once
been able to place his<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c009'><sup>[54]</sup></a> feet on my head at the time when
he departed this life. Did such a virtuous person die an
inauspicious death? It is for this reason that I am remaining
without food. Ye are the children of this poor woman;
looking on you and Bindu Madhab, I shall, this day, take
for my food the orts of our reverend priest. Do not shed
your tears before me.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>With tears in her eyes.</em>) Oh young Bou!

<p class='c010'><i>Priest.</i> (<em>To Soirindri.</em>) My daughter, thou art a great
lover of thy husband, a woman of constancy; the frame of
thy body was created in a good moment. For one who is so
entirely devoted to her husband, and who has every thing
good on her part, Fortune may give life to her husband again;
he is moving his eyes, serve him without fear. Sadhu, remain
here till our madam be in her senses.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Exit Priest.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Sadhu.</i> Just see and place your hand on her nose. The
body is become stiffer than that of a dead body.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> (<em>Speaking slowly to Reboti, after placing the
hand on the nose.</em>) Her breathing is full, but the fire coming
out of the head is so very intense that my throat, as it
were, burns.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Has the Gomastah (head clerk) fallen into the
hands of the Sahebs while he is gone to bring the physician?
Let me go to the lodging-house of that physician.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Exit Sadhu.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Soirindri.</i> Ah! Ah, my Lord! that mother for whose
abstinence from food thou hast grieved so much; that mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>for whose weakness thou hadst served her feet; that mother,
who for some days was, by no means, able to sleep without
placing thee in her lap, that very same dear mother is now
lying senseless before thee, and thou art not seeing her once
(<em>seeing Sabitri</em>). <em>As the cow losing her young one wanders
about with loud cries, then being bit by a serpent falls down
dead on the field</em>; so the mother is lying senseless on the
ground being grieved for her dear son. My Lord open thine eyes
once more; call thy maid-servant<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c009'><sup>[55]</sup></a> once more with thy sweet
voice and thus satisfy her ears once. The sun of happiness
has set at noon for me; what shall my Bipin do? (<em>With tears

<p class='c010'><i>Saralota.</i> Ye who an here take hold of our sister.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Soirindri.</i> (<em>Rising up</em>). I became an orphan while very
young; it is for this death-like Indigo that my father was
taken to the Factory, and he returned no more. That
place became to him the residence of Yama (Death). My
poor mother took me to the house of my maternal uncle, and
there through grief for her husband, she bade adieu to the
world. My uncles preserved me; I remained like a flower
accidently let fall from the hand of the gardener. My Lord
took me up with love and increased my honour. I forgot the
sorrow for my parents, and in the life of my husband my
parents were, as it were, revived (<em>deep sigh</em>). All my griefs
are rising up anew in my mind. Ah! If I be deprived of
that husband who keeps every thing under the shade of
his protection, I shall again become the same helpless orphan.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nobin’s Aunt.</i> (<em>Raising her with the hands</em>). What fear
my daughter? Why become so full of anxiety? A letter
is sent to Bindu Madhab to bring a doctor. He will be
cured when the doctor comes. (<em>Falls down upon the

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><i>Soirindri.</i> My aunt-in-law, while I was a girl I made a

happy in a future state in the same proportion as he had
suffered misery in this. My Lord, I your bond-maid will
pray to God for life; thou wast most virtuous, the
doer of great good to others and the supporter of the
poor. The Great Lord of the Universe, who provides for
the helpless, must give you a place. Ah! take me,
my Lord, with thee, that I may supply thee, with the
flowers for the worship of God. “Ah! what loss! what
ruin! I see that Rama is going to the wilderness leaving
his Sita alone. What shall I do? Where shall I go?
and how shall I preserve my life? Oh friend of the
distressed, Oh Romanath! Oh Great Wealth of the
woman, supply me some means in this distress, and preserve
me. I see that Nobin Madhab is now being burnt in
the fire of Indigo. Oh, Lord of the distressed! Where is
my husband going now, making me unfortunate and without
support,” (<em>placing her hand on the breast of Nobin, and

Now the child is born, I shall give it that name. My husband
always said, When shall the child be born, and I shall call him
by the name “Nobin Madhab” (<em>weeps</em>). If he had been

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> So great a misfortune has now come to pass!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> (<em>Sitting near Nobin</em>). It is very probable
and also according to the Nidana<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c009'><sup>[63]</sup></a> that while she is not
taking food for the death of her husband, and while she has
seen this miserable condition of her dearest son, she should

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> Ah! the light of the understanding will not

any other bad symptom. The doctors are ignorant in other

and some were going to lie down in their beds after

<p class='c010'><i>Second.</i> The stroke on the head appears fatal. What

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Two hundred ryots with clubs in their hands
are crying aloud, “Strike off, Strike off,” and are weeping
with these words in their mouths, “Ah! eldest Babu! Ah

if the Saheb get the least excuse, he will, on account <a id='corr89.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='of the of the'>of the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_89.30'><ins class='correction' title='of the of the'>of the</ins></a></span> pain in his nose, burn the whole village.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> Now, wash the head and apply turpentine
to it; in the evening, I shall come again and try some other

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Physician.</i> How is she now? Did you give her that
medicine?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> The medicine did not act, and whatever went
down immediately came up by a vomit. See her pulse once
more now; I think, it is n sign of her end.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> She is crying out, thorns, thorns. I have prepared
her bed so thickly,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c009'><sup>[68]</sup></a> still she is tossing about. Now save
her by a good medicine. Dear Sir, this relative is very
dear unto me.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> We don’t see any sign of the pulse.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> (<em>Taking hold of the hand</em>). In this state,
it is good for the pulse to be weak. “Weakness makes the
pulse strong; to have a strong pulse is fatal.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> At this time, it is the same thing either to
apply or not to apply the medicine. The parents have hope
to the very end; therefore, see, if there be any means.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> The water with which the Atapa (dried rice)
is washed, is now necessary. The application of the Shuchikavaran
(a medicine) is required.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> That Atapa which the Barah Renee sent for
offerings of prayer is in the other room. Raychurn, bring
that here.</p>

<div class='c014'>(<em>Exit Raychurn.</em>)</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Reboti.</i> Is Annapurnah<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c009'><sup>[69]</sup></a> now awake, that she shall with
the rice in her hands come to me my Khetromani? It is
through my ill-fate that our mistress is become mad.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> She is already full of sorrow for the death
of her husband; again, her son is on the point of death; her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>insanity is on the increase. I think she shall die before
Nobin; she is become very weak.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Sir, how did you find our eldest Babu, to-day?
I think, with his pure blood he has extinguished the fire of
tyranny of the giants, the Indigo Planters. It is probable,
that the Indigo Commission might produce to the ryots
some advantages; but what effect has that? If one hundred
serpents do bite at once my whole body I can bear that;
if on a hearth made of bricks, a frypan placed full of
molasses, and the same be boiling by a great fire, I can also
bear the torments, if by accident I fall into the pan; if in the
dark night of the new-moon a band of robbers with terrible
sounds come upon and kill my only son who is honest and
very learned, take away all the acquisitions made during the
past seven generations, and then make me blind: all these
also, I can bear; and in the place of one, even if there be
ten Indigo Factories in the village, that also I can allow;
but to be separated even for a moment from that elder Babu
who is so much the supporter of his dependants, that can I
never bear.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> The blow through which the brain has oozed
out is fatal. I have found the pulse indicate that death is
near; either at mid-day or in the evening, life will depart.
Bipin gave a little water of the Ganges in his mouth, but it
came out by its sides. Nobin’s wife is quite distracted; but
she is trying her utmost for his safety.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Ah! Ah! Had our mistress not been insane, her
heart would have been burst asunder on seeing this. The
doctor has also said, that the bruise on the head is fatal.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> The doctor is a very kind-hearted man: when
Babu Bindu wanted to give him money, he said, “Babu
Bindu, the manner in which you are already troubled makes
it improbable that the ceremony of your father will be performed.
I cannot take any thing from you now, and also it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>is not necessary for you to give money for the bearers who
brought me and who will now take me away.” Had the
doctor been of a hard heart, he would have taken away the
money kept for the ceremony. I have seen that kind of
doctors twice; he is as scurrilous as avaricious.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sadhu.</i> Our young Babu brought along with him the
doctor to see Khetromani; but he said nothing with certainty.
The doctor observing my want, owing to the tyranny
of the Planters, gave me two rupees in the name of
Khetromani.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Physician.</i> Had the doctor been hard-hearted he
would have taken hold of the hand, and said, she would
die; and he would have taken the money by selling
your kine.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> I can give money by selling off whatever I have,
if they can only cure my Khetro.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reboti.</i> Our mistress (Sabitri) went to Gya and brought

<p class='c010'><i>Bindu.</i> As the mother, having destroyed the child whom
she was fondling for making it sleep on her lap, on awaking
will go to destroy herself, so wilt thou, Oh my mother! go to
kill thyself, if thine insanity passing off thou can’st understand,
that thy most beloved Saralota was murdered by
thee. It will be good if that lamp no more give its light to
thee. Ah! how very pleasant it is for a woman to be mad,
who has lost her husband and son! The deer-like mind being
enclosed within the stone walls of madness can never be
attacked by the great tiger Sorrow. I am thy Bindu
Madhab.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> What, what do you say?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Bindu.</i> Mother, I can no longer keep my life, becoming

<p class='c010'><i>Sabitri.</i> What! Is my Nobin dead! Is my Nobin dead!
Ah, my dear son, my dear Bindu Madhab! Have I killed
your Saralota? Have I killed my young Bou by becoming mad

mama will no more come out of my mouth, (<em>weeps</em>). Let me
place the dust of her feet on my head (<em>takes the dust from

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span><i>Bindu.</i> My Bipin is now the pole-star in the ocean of
dangers! (<em>with deep sigh</em>). In this world of short existence,
human life is as the bank of a river which has a most violent
course and the greatest depth. How very beautiful are the
banks, the fields covered over with new grass, most pleasant
to the view, the trees full of branches newly coming out;
in some places the cottages of fishermen; in others the
kine feeding with their young ones. To walk about in such
a place enjoying the sweet songs of the beautiful birds, and
the charming gale full of the sweet smell of flowers, only
wraps the mind in the contemplation of that Being who is
full of pleasure. Accidentally, a hole small as a line is observed
in the field, and immediately that most pleasant bank falls
down into the stream. How very sorrowful! The Bose family
of Svaropur is destroyed by Indigo, the great destroyer of
honour. How very terrible are the arms of Indigo!</p>

<p class='c010'>The cobra de capello, like the Indigo Planters, with
mouths full of poison, threw all happiness into the flame of
fire. The father, through injustice, died in the prison; the
elder brother in the Indigo-field, and the mother, being insane
through grief for her husband and son, murdered with her
own hands a most honest woman. Getting her understanding
again, and observing my sorrow, the ocean of grief again
swelled in her. With that disease of sorrow came the poison
of want; and thus without attending to consolation, she also
departed this life. Incessantly do I call, Where is my father?
Where is my father? Embrace me once more with a smiling
face. Crying out, Oh mother! Oh mother! I look on all sides;
but that countenance of joy do I find no where. When I used
to call, Mama, she immediately took me on her breast, and rubbed
my mouth. Who knows the greatness of maternal affection?
The cry of mama, mama, mama, mama do I make in
the battle-field and the wilderness whenever fear arises in
the mind. Oh my brother, dear unto the heart, in the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of whom there is not one, as a friend in this world! Thy Bindu
Madhab is come! open thine eyes once more and see. Ah!
ah! it bursts my heart, not to know where my hearts Sarala
is gone to. The most beautiful, wise, and entirely devoted to
me; she walked as the swan,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c009'><sup>[79]</sup></a> and her eyes were handsome as
those of the deer. With a smiling face and with the sweetest
voice, thou didst read to me the <em>Betal</em>. The mind was
charmed by thy sweet reading which was as the singing of
the bird in the forest. Thou, Sarala, hadst a most beauteous
face, and didst brighten the lake of my heart. Who did
take away my lotus with a cruel heart? The beautiful lake
became dark. The world I look upon is as a desert full of
corpses; while I have lost my father, my mother, my brother,
and my wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ah! where are they gone to in search of the dead body
of my brother? I am to prepare for going to the Ganges as
soon as they come. Ah! how very terrible, the last scene of
the drama of the lion-like Nobin Madhab is? (<em>Sits down,
taking hold of Sabitri’s feet</em>).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

For additional contact information:

    Dr. Gregory B. Newby
    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
